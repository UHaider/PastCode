Credits: A major code reused from http://projectproto.blogspot.com/2010/09/android-bluetooth-oscilloscope.html for bluetooth interfacing
and display only. Please mention this if you are using this code. Thanks.

This folder contains three java files that are used in one of my project. Goal of this project
was to read data coming on bluetooth and display its Spectrum (magnitue / phase). User should be able to
select from different windows (Hamming/Hanning etc).
